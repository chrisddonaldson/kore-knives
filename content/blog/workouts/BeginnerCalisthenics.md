# Why

The first lockdown in the UK made me rethink my training program. Previously I was performing mainly barbell exercises with accessory work using dumbells and machines. I enjoyed this method of training and was getting pretty good at it when the frist shut down happened.

I moved my attention on to volume work, increasing my max total pull ups, pressups and body weight squats. I've been focusing on these basic exercises for a while now and I was excided to try my new strength back at the gym when my hopes were dash a few weeks ago with the annocement of tier 4 lock downs.

With my new foundation of strength and continuing lack of workout facilaties, I want to focus on learning some advanced body weight movements.
