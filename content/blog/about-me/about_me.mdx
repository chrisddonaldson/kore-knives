        I've been living in South London since I graduated from Loughborough
        University in 2017. landed a job at a English country furniture company
        called Jamb as product development coordinator and threw myself into my
        work. Over a three year period I was responsible for managing the
        development and delivery of many products including luxury brass
        lanterns and marble fireplaces, some of examples of which you can see
        here.

        My day to day activities included handling and refining 3d scan data of
        antiques, modelling products and producing engineering drawings, and
        managing a chain of suppliers and crafts people to deliver the product
        on time. The largest project I worked on was generating the CAD of a
        ornate 3.5m tall hanging lantern.

        During my time at Jamb I realised how powerful programming was with
        automating some of the repetitive tasks the business needed to do. I
        built a quality control system which documented and tracked issues with
        products and a centralised product database which helped keep track of
        all the product technical information whilst being presentable to
        technical users.

        I have worked with multiple tech stacks. My latest one is a MySQL
        database with a Python Django backend and a React Redux front end. This
        is the one I'm building my latest projects with. You can find out more
        about my skills here.

        During the same trip, we crossed the border into Hong Kong to meet with
        more suppliers. I had the best sea food of my life!

        When I'm not behind my computer (or in lockdown) I enjoy travelling. At
        Jamb I was lucky to visit the workshops in China. Here I am at dinner
        with one of the suppliers.

        I visited Taiwan in 2018. The trip involved a lot of hiking and sight
        seeing. Very nearly came back with a dog.

        Last year I went on a three day camping/ kayaking trip in Loch Lomond in
        Scotland. We were caught out by a storm and were stranded on a small
        island for 24 hours. Luckily we came prepared so it ended up being a
        good laugh.

        My experience in Asia is what has inspired me to learn Mandarin. My goal
        is to pass to HSK3 by 2022. As I'm learning I'm documenting my
        experience at and learning resources on a webapp which will be available
        for public viewing shortly.

        In my free time I stay active with weight lifting, rock climbing and
        running. I have a goal of 25 non-stop pull ups by the end of 2020.

        I also spend time making illustrations, digital painting and 3d models/
        renders. You can find more in my portfolio section.
