## What cha got, Kid?

Well, let me tell you.
What started as a passion for all things related to the internet has evolved into an arsenal of skills and abilities that make me well suited for the fast moving world of web development. From front end to back end, from 2d to 3d, I've got you covered.

## Front End

The very first piece of code I wrote was a HTML document describing the best strategy to win at a game called Puzzel Pirates. 12 year old Chris and 25 year old Chris share the same passion of displaying information in the clearest, most concise way possible. I'm well versed in Javascript with over 3 years of experience. My current favorite front end framework is React.

Back End

From a simple google spreadsheet, my life management app Jean out grew its plant pot and required a more robust solution. I built version one in Java, version 2 in Python using the flask frame work. Since then I've expanded my back end knowledge to include Node.js and even Django. Most of my database experience is with mySQL although for smaller applications I have used MongoDB.

Graphics and User Experience

Illustration and digital painting are one of my passions. This has given me a extraordinary amount of hours using programs in the adobe suite like Photoshop, Illutsrator, Indesign and even Premier Pro. This complements my development skills as I am able to quickly switch between programs to achieve a unquie design. I do all of my prototyping in Adobes XD and find it super useful for fleshing out my ideas with clients and team members.

3D Graphics and CAD

My background in design and engineering has given me a lot of experience working with and manipulating 3d objects. My favorite parametric software is Solidworks and my favorite polygonal software is Blender (bonus points for the python api). I've made all kinds of models: engineering models and drawings to assist with manufacturing, textured game ready models for unity hackathons, even large scale ornate models ready for 3d printing.
