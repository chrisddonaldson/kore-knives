## What is Jean

Anyone who knows me for any serious amount of time will know about Jean.

I've had this idea for a piece of software for a while now.

Over the past 4 years I've been tinkering away at what is best described as a personal scheduling assistant.

There are ways to organise your life using software that people are not yet taking advantage of.

Most of the activities you do happen every day. 

I think it is important to create, I want to create constantly. My being doesn't neseccarly alow for that.

My being as in I need to eat, sleep, maintain my body, change my habbits, keep the money coming in.

I am trapped by my biology. I suppose that is the curse of every living being. Thankfully Im in a position to do something about it.

I want to find a way to maintain order over my physical being in a hyper-effecient way in order to make best use of my life.

A huge amount of time is dedicated to my biologically.

I want jean to work as a data collection enterty as in it should remind you what info you need to fill out.

Simple things like exercise programs, diet programs, work cycles all have elements that can be tracked and automatically planned.

The homepage of Jean makes this plan for you. First, it needs some varaibles.

You start with the schduling logic you want to implement.

Jean uses schedulers to organsie events.

Jean comes with some standard options for schedule but can also be exteneded with custom shedules.

For example, the sleep scheduler.

When are you asleep, when are you awake.

Chris:

    On weekdays, I wake up at 5:30 and I go to sleep around 11pm.
    I have 1 nap in the afternoon at around 4 for about 20 mins.
    On Saturday I wake up at 9am but I get out of bed at 10am,

Brie:

    On weekdays, I wake up at 7:00 and I go to sleep around 11pm.

    At least 6 hours of solid dev work for digital labs every working day.

## The Sleep Scheduler

The sleep scheduler will take your start time and end time ( or your length ) and figure out the relationship between them.

The events list created needes to span over the 24 hr period.

As in, if you wake up at 5 and go to sleep at 10 you need to make 2 events. One for the morning part and one for the evening part.

You should be able to add naps to the calendar.

The schduler should be able to look back into the past and see how much you slept for a particular day. It should be able to split into different views representing the data.

I suppose this means that the day's schedule is stored as some kind of collection.

## The Work Sheduler

The work scheduler should let you add to your calendar "work blocks and then programatically add pomodoro sessions.

Click on the "work" paint brush.

Tap where abouts you want the window.

Set the specifics (Start time, end time, number of breaks, lenght of break/ working session) (This function is mirrored in the diet window)

Should be able to choose bettween types of length curves. -> Building up towards the end

Should be able to make and name custom schedulers like drawing practice, chinese, Digital labs work, Visio impulse work.

Next tier would be to intergrate a todo but that is a bit too high concept.

## The Diet Sheduler

Select your earting window

Number of meals, meal names and aprox prep/ duration

Must be able to adjust the length of various elemenets, dinner is longer than a snack

This whole thing will link to the diet and food service that also serves I crumb from a land down under

At the start of the day your acitivties need to be generetae

## The Workout Scheduler

Need to be able to select and move around the workout block for today

Take my list of exercises and apply effort curves

Take the exercises and stack them up

Workout plan builder

Workout program builder

Workout scheduler takes a program and applys it to the calendar based on a start date.

If a program is planned in for today

## Goal bubbles

You should be able to set a meta target for work per day or exercise per day and see that in a screen nearby

Once you've made your plan you should be able to analysis it to see how much you're getting done.
