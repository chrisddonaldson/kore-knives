I found that working out from home gave me an oppertunity to focus on some of the areas I felt I was lacking in.

For instance the handstand.

Why does anyone care about the handstand,

I think my audience wants to improve. They wish to be better to be more than they current are.

I am extremely cursious about the man I could possibly become. Who is he and what is he good at.

Functional strength. Theh correct balance of healthy, atheletic and big.

He needs to be smart. He needs to make time for practing skills. He needs to read and explore ideas. He needs to make best use of his time.

He needs to author. He needs to take photos, make music, write, do drawings, make content, make website, make apps, build things, upgrade things.

Authoring
