## How Chinese Characters Work

### Pinyin

Pinyin is the system which describes how chinese symbols sound when converted into english sounding letters.

For example.

### Tones

A Chinese syllable is usually made up of an initial, a final and a tone. Genreally speaking, one Chinese character corresponds to one syllable. A Chinese syllable can have no initial, but must have a final and a tone.

-Images of the tones-

### Tone Sandhi: Double 3rd tone

Just like in English, rules are not always universal.

When two third tone syllables are read in sequence, the first syllable turns into the second tone. For example, the 3 to 3 sequence becomes a 2 to 3.

There are four basic tones in Chinese, respectively called the 1st, 2nd 3rd and 4th tone.
